### Goal

`inbreedR` provides functions and workflows for the analysis of
inbreeding and heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs) based on
molecular markers such as microsatellites and SNPs. In case of genomic
data, itâ€™s most useful for lower density datasets where it is unclear
whether genotyped markers represent genome-wide diversity / inbreeding.
It has four main application areas:

-   Quantifying variance in inbreeding through estimation of identitiy
    disequilibria (g2), heterozygosity-heterozygosity correlations (HHC)
    and variance in standardized multilocus heterozygosity (sMLH)

-   Calculating g2 for small and large SNP datasets. The use of
    `data.table` and parallelization speed up bootstrapping and
    permutation tests

-   Estimating central parameters within HFC theory, such as the
    influence of inbreeding on heterozygosity and fitness, and their
    confidence intervals.

-   Exploring the sensitivity of these measures towards the number of
    genetic markers using simulations

### Installation

You can install the stable version of `inbreedR` from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("rptR")
```

Or the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mastoffel/inbreedR", build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE) 
# manual
browseVignettes("inbreedR")
```

If you find a bug, please report a minimal reproducible example in the
[issues](https://github.com/mastoffel/inbreedR/issues).
